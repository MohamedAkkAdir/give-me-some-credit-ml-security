# Give Me Some Credit - ML Security Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores **adversarial machine learning, privacy attacks, and bias mitigation** using the **Give Me Some Credit** dataset. The goal is to evaluate how robust financial models are against **adversarial attacks, privacy threats, and biases**.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Name:** Give Me Some Credit
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samhita/give-me-some-credit-dataset)
- **Objective:** Predict the probability of a customer **defaulting** on their credit.
